All models are stored in this folder.

Prior to start the application fo rthe first time, run the `ml_code.ipynb` notebook in order to populate this folder with at least the baseline model.

Models are saved in a single folder containing the following files:
* `metadata.json` file for metadata information,
* `mms.model` model object for the MinMaxScaler pre-processing,
* `skb.model` model object for the SelectKBest pre-processing,
* `neuralnet.model` PyTorch model of the trained NeuralNetwork.
