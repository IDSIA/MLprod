# Grafana storage folder

Files under the `provisioning` folder are used to define the *data sources* and *dashboars* available at the start of the application.

Files under the `dashboards` folder are the dashboards that will be visualized in Grafana.

Remember that the dashboards uploaded in this way are not editable.
